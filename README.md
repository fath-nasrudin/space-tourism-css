# Space Tourism Website
live website: https://fath-nasrudin.github.io/space-tourism-css

Space Tourism Website is a static website created to sharpen my CSS, JS, and HTML skills. This project has been a great opportunity for me to focus on improving accessibility, responsive design, art direction, design system, and DOM manipulation techniques.

One notable aspect of this project is that it was developed entirely without the use of any frameworks. I wanted to challenge myself to rely solely on core web technologies, pushing the boundaries of what I could achieve.
